# Workflow Management

## Project Tracking
- **Always create `/projectinfo` folder if it doesn't exist**
- Track all progress in `/projectinfo/progress.md`
- Document key decisions and changes in projectinfo folder
- Update [todo.md](mdc:todo.md) for ongoing task management

## Development Workflow
1. **Before making changes**: Ask for clarification if anything is unclear
2. **During implementation**: Follow the "fewer lines of code" principle
3. **After implementation**: **Always ask "do you want to review the code use code review template boss?"**

## Git Commit Standards
- Follow the established commit message format
- Include meaningful descriptions of changes
- Reference related issues or tasks when applicable

## Code Review Process
- Always offer code review after completing implementation
- Use the established code review template
- Address all review feedback before considering task complete

## Documentation Updates
- Update relevant documentation files when making changes
- Keep [project_summary.md](mdc:project_summary.md) current with major changes
- Update [deployment_notes.md](mdc:deployment_notes.md) if deployment process changes

## Communication Standards
- Ask for permission before modifying existing features
- Clarify requirements if they seem ambiguous
- Provide status updates on complex implementations
- Request feedback when multiple approaches are possible

## Quality Assurance
- Test all implemented features thoroughly
- Ensure code runs immediately without additional setup
- Verify all dependencies are properly included
- Check that changes don't break existing functionality
