# Coding Standards

## Response Format
- Provide direct code solutions instead of high-level descriptions
- Show only relevant code changes with minimal context
- Split long responses into multiple messages if needed

## Code Quality Standards
- **The fewer lines of code, the better** - prioritize concise, readable solutions
- Implement proper error handling for all functions and API calls
- Add comments only for complex logic - avoid obvious comments
- **Never delete existing code comments** - preserve all existing documentation
- **Never change existing features and logic** without explicit permission
- **Always ask if anything is unclear** before modifying existing code
- **Never change anything not related to the mentioned requirement**

## Code Consistency
- Respect existing prettier preferences and formatting
- Follow existing naming conventions in the codebase
- Maintain consistent indentation and style with existing code
- Use existing patterns and structures when adding new features

## Implementation Requirements
- **Do not stop working until the feature is fully and completely implemented**
- Test all code changes before considering the task complete
- Ensure all dependencies and imports are properly included
- Make code runnable immediately without additional setup steps
