# Singapore Primary School System and P1 Admission Overview

## Primary School System
Singapore's primary education system is compulsory for all Singapore Citizens born after January 1, 1996, and typically starts at age seven. It consists of a six-year program, divided into a four-year foundation stage (Primary 1 to 4) and a two-year orientation stage (Primary 5 to 6). At the end of Primary 6, students take the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).

## P1 Admission Process
The Primary 1 (P1) registration exercise is conducted annually, usually from July to August, for children entering Primary 1 the following year. The process is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE) and is conducted online through the P1 Registration Portal.

### Registration Phases
The P1 registration process is structured into several phases to accommodate different eligibility groups. These phases prioritize children based on various criteria, including:
- **Phase 1:** For children with siblings currently studying in the school.
- **Phase 2A:** For children whose parents are former students of the school and have joined the alumni association, or whose parents are members of the School Advisory Committee/Management Committee.
- **Phase 2B:** For children whose parents have volunteered in the school, are active community leaders, or are endorsed by the church/clan associated with the school.
- **Phase 2C:** For children who are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and do not qualify for earlier phases. This is the most competitive phase.
- **Phase 2C Supplementary:** For children who are Singapore Citizens or Permanent Residents and have not been allocated a school in Phase 2C.
- **Phase 3:** For international students.

### Importance of Distance (1km and 2km)
A crucial factor in P1 registration, particularly in Phase 2C, is the proximity of the child's home to the school. Priority is given to Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents residing within:
- **1km of the school:** Children living within 1km of the school have the highest priority.
- **1km to 2km of the school:** Children living between 1km and 2km of the school have the next priority.

If the number of applicants exceeds the available vacancies within a certain distance band, balloting will be conducted. This highlights the importance of strategic planning for parents aiming for specific schools.

### Key Dates
Key dates for P1 registration are announced annually by MOE. For example, the P1 Registration Exercise for 2026 admission is expected to begin on July 1, 2025.
