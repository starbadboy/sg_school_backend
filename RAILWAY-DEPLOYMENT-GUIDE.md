# üöÇ Railway Deployment Guide - Singapore School Finder

## üéØ **Quick Railway Deployment**

Your project is **Railway-ready** with the `nixpacks.toml` configuration! Follow these steps:

### 1. **Run the Railway Deployment Script**
```bash
chmod +x deploy-railway.sh
./deploy-railway.sh
```

### 2. **Push to GitHub**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: ready for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. **Configure Railway Environment Variables**

In your Railway project dashboard:
1. Go to **Variables** tab
2. Add these environment variables:

```env
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=sg-school-finder-secure-key-2024
PORT=8080
```

### 4. **Deploy & Monitor**
- Railway will **automatically redeploy** when it detects the GitHub push
- Monitor the build process in Railway's **Deployments** tab
- Your app will be live at: `https://your-project-name.railway.app`

## üîß **Railway Configuration Explained**

### **nixpacks.toml** (Tells Railway how to build):
```toml
[phases.setup]
nixPkgs = ['nodejs', 'python310']  # Install Node.js + Python

[phases.install]
cmds = [
    'cd sg-school-frontend && npm ci',           # Install frontend deps
    'cd sg_school_backend && pip install -r requirements.txt'  # Install backend deps
]

[phases.build]
cmds = [
    'cd sg-school-frontend && npm run build'    # Build React app (outputs directly to Flask static)
]

[start]
cmd = 'cd sg_school_backend && python src/main.py'  # Start Flask server
```

### **Database Auto-Initialization** ‚ú® **NEW**:
- ‚úÖ **Automatic P1 data loading** when database is empty
- ‚úÖ **No manual migration required** - works on fresh deployments
- ‚úÖ **Finds data files automatically** from multiple locations:
  - `extracted_p1_school_data.json` (root directory)
  - `p1_2024_complete_data.json` (database folder)
  - `p1_2024_data.json` (database folder)

### **Vite Configuration** (vite.config.js):
- ‚úÖ Builds **directly to Flask static folder** (`../sg_school_backend/src/static`)
- ‚úÖ No manual file copying needed
- ‚úÖ Optimized build process for Railway

### **Dockerfile** (For alternative deployments):
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - No longer tries to copy from non-existent `dist` folder
- ‚úÖ Works with Vite's direct build output
- ‚úÖ Compatible with Docker-based platforms (Fly.io, DigitalOcean, etc.)

### **Flask Production Settings** (main.py):
- ‚úÖ Reads `PORT` from environment variables
- ‚úÖ Switches debug mode based on `FLASK_ENV`
- ‚úÖ Uses secure `SECRET_KEY` from environment
- ‚úÖ **Auto-initializes database** with P1 data on startup

---

## ‚ö° **Railway-Specific Tips**

### **Environment Variables Best Practices:**
- `FLASK_ENV=production` ‚Üí Disables debug mode, improves performance
- `SECRET_KEY` ‚Üí Use a strong, unique key for sessions
- `PORT=8080` ‚Üí Railway's default port (auto-assigned)

### **Database Auto-Population:**
- **Smart detection** - only populates if database is empty
- **Multiple data sources** - tries different P1 data files
- **Production-ready** - happens automatically on every fresh deployment
- **No manual steps** - works out of the box

### **Build Process Optimization:**
- **Vite builds directly** to Flask static folder
- **No intermediate file copying** required
- **Faster builds** with streamlined process

### **Monitoring Your Deployment:**
1. **Build Logs**: Check if frontend/backend build successfully
2. **Runtime Logs**: Monitor Flask application startup and database initialization
3. **Metrics**: Track CPU/memory usage in Railway dashboard
4. **Database Status**: Look for "‚úÖ Database initialization complete!" in logs

### **Auto-Deployment:**
- Every `git push` to main branch triggers automatic deployment
- Railway detects changes and rebuilds using nixpacks.toml
- Zero downtime deployments

## üö® **Troubleshooting Railway Issues**

### **Build Fails with "Nixpacks Error":**
- Ensure `nixpacks.toml` is in repository root
- Check that both frontend and backend directories exist
- Verify package.json and requirements.txt are present

### **Docker Build Fails with "No such file or directory":**
- ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Dockerfile updated to work with Vite direct build
- No more `dist` folder copying errors
- Build process matches Railway nixpacks configuration

### **Database is Empty After Deployment:** ‚úÖ **FIXED**
- ‚úÖ **Auto-initialization added** - database populates automatically
- Check Railway logs for database initialization messages
- Verify P1 data files are included in repository
- Look for "üîç Checking database initialization..." in startup logs

### **App Starts but Frontend Not Loading:**
- Check that frontend build completed successfully
- Verify Vite build outputs to `sg_school_backend/src/static/`
- Ensure Flask serves static files correctly

### **Database Errors:**
- SQLite database is created automatically
- P1 data is loaded automatically from JSON files
- Check `sg_school_backend/src/database/` folder exists
- Ensure database path is correct in Flask config

### **Port Binding Issues:**
- Railway assigns PORT automatically
- Don't hardcode port 5002 in production
- Use `PORT` environment variable (already configured)

## ‚úÖ **Deployment Checklist**

Before deploying to Railway:
- [ ] Run `./deploy-railway.sh` successfully
- [ ] Frontend builds without errors (check for index.html in static folder)
- [ ] Backend dependencies install correctly
- [ ] nixpacks.toml is in repository root
- [ ] Environment variables configured in Railway
- [ ] P1 data files are in repository (auto-detected)
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub main branch

### **Expected Timeline:**
- **Build Time**: 2-3 minutes
- **Deploy Time**: 30 seconds
- **Database Initialization**: 10-30 seconds (automatic)
- **Total**: 3-4 minutes from push to live

## üéâ **Post-Deployment**

Once deployed successfully:
1. **Test your live app** at the Railway URL
2. **Verify all features work** (school search, P1 flow, etc.)
3. **Check database population**: School search should return results
4. **Share your live Singapore School Finder** with users!

### **Expected Database Status:**
- **180+ schools** with P1 data automatically loaded
- **Balloting information** for competitive schools
- **Success rates** and competitiveness analysis
- **All features working** without manual setup

**üåü Your Railway deployment is production-ready with automatic database initialization!**
