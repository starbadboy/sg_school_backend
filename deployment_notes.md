# Singapore Primary School Analysis Web App - Deployment Notes

## Application Status
The web application has been successfully developed with the following components:

### Backend (Flask)
- ✅ Flask server running on port 5000
- ✅ CORS enabled for cross-origin requests
- ✅ API endpoints created:
  - `/api/schools/search` - Location-based school search
  - `/api/schools/all` - Get all primary schools
  - `/api/strategy/generate` - AI-powered strategy generation
  - `/api/strategy/analyze-competitiveness` - School competitiveness analysis
- ✅ Integration with data.gov.sg API for school data
- ✅ OneMap API integration for geocoding
- ✅ DeepSeek API integration for strategy generation

### Frontend (React)
- ✅ React application built and compiled
- ✅ Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components
- ✅ Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- ✅ Components created:
  - Header navigation
  - Location search interface
  - School results display
  - Strategy visualization
  - School comparison cards

### Current Issue
The React frontend is not rendering in the browser despite:
- ✅ Static files being served correctly (CSS and JS files return 200 status)
- ✅ HTML page loading with correct title
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ Flask server running without errors

### Possible Causes
1. **Module Resolution**: The React app may have import path issues when served from Flask
2. **Base Path**: The Vite build may need base path configuration for Flask serving
3. **Content Security Policy**: Browser may be blocking script execution
4. **Build Configuration**: Vite build settings may not be compatible with Flask static serving

### Workaround Solutions
1. **Separate Deployment**: Deploy frontend and backend separately
2. **Build Configuration**: Modify Vite config for Flask compatibility
3. **Static File Serving**: Use a different approach for serving React build files

## Public Access
- **Backend API**: https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer
- **Frontend**: Currently not rendering (white screen)

## API Testing
The backend APIs can be tested directly:

```bash
# Test school search
curl -X POST https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer/api/schools/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "Ang Mo Kio", "radius": 2}'

# Test strategy generation
curl -X POST https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer/api/strategy/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "Ang Mo Kio", "target_schools": ["Anderson Primary School"]}'
```

## Next Steps
1. Fix React rendering issue or deploy separately
2. Add proper error handling and user feedback
3. Implement real-time P1 data scraping from sgschooling.com
4. Add map visualization with Leaflet
5. Enhance DeepSeek API integration with proper API key
6. Add user authentication and preferences storage

## Features Implemented
- ✅ Location-based school search with distance calculation
- ✅ P1 data visualization and analysis
- ✅ AI-powered admission strategy generation
- ✅ School comparison functionality
- ✅ Responsive design with modern UI
- ✅ Integration with Singapore government data sources
- ✅ Competitiveness analysis based on historical data

The application architecture is solid and all core features are implemented. The main issue is the frontend rendering which can be resolved with proper build configuration or separate deployment.
