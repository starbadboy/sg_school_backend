#### ‚úÖ School Comparison Feature Fix (July 19, 2025)
- **User Issue**: "the school compare showing nothing now"
- **Problem**: School Comparison page was completely blank due to missing empty state handling
- **Root Cause**: App.jsx only rendered comparison view when `comparisonSchools.length > 0`, so users never saw the empty state

#### ‚úÖ Blue Tick Button UX Fix (July 19, 2025)
- **User Issue**: "the tick button not able to add to compare?"
- **Problem**: Confusing UX with two separate buttons for different purposes
- **Root Cause**: Blue tick button (top-right) only selected schools for AI Strategy, didn't add to comparison
- **Solution Applied**:
  - ‚úÖ **Unified Functionality**: Blue tick button now does BOTH actions simultaneously
  - ‚úÖ **Single Click**: One click selects for AI Strategy AND adds to comparison

- **Result**: Complete transparency of balloting conditions and detailed statistics for informed decision-making

#### ‚úÖ Fixed React-Markdown ClassName Error (July 19, 2025)
- **Issue**: `Uncaught Assertion: Unexpected className prop` error in StrategyView component
- **Root Cause**: Newer version of `react-markdown` no longer accepts `className` prop directly
- **Solution Applied**:
  - **Removed** `className="text-slate-900 leading-relaxed"` from `ReactMarkdown` component
  - **Wrapped** `ReactMarkdown` in a `div` with the same styling classes
  - **Preserved** all custom component styling through the `components` prop
- **Result**: AI Strategy generation now works without React-Markdown errors

#### ‚úÖ Restored Search Radius Selection (July 19, 2025)
- **User Feedback**: "the search school i cannot choose the radius now?"
- **Issue**: Radius selection was removed during search card redesign, hardcoded to 2km
- **Solution Applied**:
  - **Added** `radius` state variable with default value of 2km
  - **Created** interactive radius selector with 4 options (1km, 2km, 3km, 5km)
  - **Beautiful UI**: Gradient button selection with active state styling
  - **Smart Descriptions**: Context-aware help text for each radius option
  - **Dynamic API**: Updated search to use selected radius instead of hardcoded value
- **Radius Options**:
  - **1km**: "Very close schools only - ideal for priority zone"

  - **3km**: "Good variety of options within reasonable distance"
  - **5km**: "Maximum choice - includes all accessible schools"
- **Result**: Users can now customize their search radius for optimal school discovery

#### ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX: Corrected P1 "Taken" Data Logic (July 19, 2025)
- **User Report**: "the data in our database seems wrong, for example this Nan Hua primary school phase 2A data, vancancis 73, and taken 1 means 1 application need to ballots from 30 applications residence outside 2km, the other 72 vancancis all taken by the applications within 2km, now our taken showing 1 only"
- **Critical Issue**: Database logic was incorrectly calculating "taken" values for balloted phases
- **Root Cause**: When balloting occurred, code only counted `vacancies_for_ballot` as "taken", missing students who got places without balloting
- **Example Problem**:
  - **WRONG**: Nan Hua Phase 2A showing "taken: 1" (only balloting winners)
  - **CORRECT**: Should show "taken: 73" (all vacancies filled = 72 within 2km + 1 via ballot)
- **Fix Applied**:
  - **Updated Logic**: `sg_school_backend/src/models/user.py` line 89
  - **OLD**: `result['taken'] = balloting_details.get('vacancies_for_ballot', result['vacancies'])`
  - **NEW**: `result['taken'] = result['vacancies']` (when balloting = all spots filled)
  - **Re-migrated Data**: All 39 schools updated with correct logic
- **Technical Understanding**:
  - **Balloting occurs** when phase is oversubscribed (applicants > vacancies)
  - **ALL vacancies get filled** (taken = total vacancies)
  - **Balloting is just the METHOD** to decide WHO gets specific spots, not the total count
- **Impact**: Success rates, competitiveness analysis, and comparison data now accurate
- **Result**: P1 data now correctly shows total students who received places in each phase

#### ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIX: Complete School Dataset Migration (July 19, 2025)
- **User Report**: "some school data seems gone?"
- **Root Cause**: Migration script was using incomplete data file with only 39 schools instead of complete dataset
- **Problem Identified**:
  - **WRONG SOURCE**: `p1_2024_complete_data.json` (56KB, only 39 schools)
  - **CORRECT SOURCE**: `extracted_p1_school_data.json` (165KB, 180 schools)
  - **Missing Schools**: Nan Hua Primary School and 141 other real Singapore primary schools
- **Migration Script Updates**:
  - **Updated Path**: Changed from `src/database/p1_2024_complete_data.json` to `../extracted_p1_school_data.json`
  - **Fixed Data Structure**: Updated parsing from object format `{"schools": {}}` to array format `{"schools": []}`
  - **Enhanced Field Mapping**: Handle `phase_2c_supplementary` vs `phase_2c_supp` field name differences
  - **Auto-Calculate Fields**: Generate `school_key`, calculate `balloted` status from phase data
  - **Improved Compatibility**: Support both `total_vacancy` and `total_vacancies` field names
- **Results**:
  - **Database Size**: Increased from 39 to **180 schools** ‚úÖ
  - **Data Completeness**: Now includes Nan Hua Primary School and other missing schools ‚úÖ
  - **Coverage**: Represents realistic Singapore primary school landscape ‚úÖ
  - **P1 Analytics**: All schools now have comprehensive phase-by-phase data ‚úÖ
- **Verification**: Nan Hua Primary School confirmed present with complete P1 phase data
- **Result**: Application now provides comprehensive coverage of Singapore primary schools with accurate P1 registration data

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Competitiveness Level Calculation (July 19, 2025)
- **User Question**: "why the unknown for the competency level"
- **Issue**: All schools showing "Unknown" competitiveness tier after migration
- **Root Cause**: Updated migration script wasn't calculating competitiveness scores from P1 data
- **Solution Applied**:
  - **Added Calculation Functions**: `calculate_competitiveness_score()` and `get_competitiveness_tier()`
  - **Weighted Scoring System**:
    - **Phase 2C**: 50% weight (most competitive indicator)
    - **Phase 2B**: 30% weight (medium indicator)  
    - **Phase 2A**: 20% weight (lower indicator)
  - **Tier Classification**:
    - **Very High**: Score ‚â• 2.0 (very oversubscribed)
    - **High**: Score ‚â• 1.5 (highly competitive)
    - **Medium**: Score ‚â• 1.2 (moderately competitive)
    - **Low**: Score ‚â• 0.8 (slightly competitive)
    - **Very Low**: Score < 0.8 (undersubscribed)
- **Updated Migration Logic**:
  - **Calculate Score**: Based on applicant-to-vacancy ratios across phases
  - **Set Tier**: Automatically classify based on calculated score
  - **Store Metrics**: Save detailed competitiveness metadata in JSON format
- **Results Examples**:
  - **Ai Tong School**: Very High (highly sought after)
  - **Admiralty Primary**: Medium (moderately competitive)
  - **Ahmad Ibrahim Primary**: Very Low (many vacancies available)
- **Result**: All 180 schools now display accurate competitiveness levels based on real P1 data analysis

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Frontend Competitiveness Display Bug (July 19, 2025)
- **User Report**: "so its frontend display issue? now still show unknown?"
- **Root Cause**: Frontend missing case for "very low" competitiveness tier
- **Investigation**: API correctly returns competitiveness data (e.g., "Very Low"), but frontend display function was incomplete
- **Bug Details**:
  - **API Returns**: "Very Low" ‚Üí **Frontend Converts**: "very low" (toLowerCase)
  - **Frontend Cases**: Only had 'very high', 'high', 'medium', 'low' - **Missing** 'very low'
  - **Result**: Fell back to 'default' case showing "Unknown"
- **Fix Applied**:
  - **SchoolResults.jsx**: Added `case 'very low'` to `getCompetitivenessDisplay()` function
  - **SchoolComparison.jsx**: Added `case 'very low'` to `getCompetitivenessDisplay()` function  
  - **Display**: "Very Low Competition" with emerald-green styling
- **Testing**: Verified API returns correct data, frontend now maps all 5 tiers properly
- **Result**: All competitiveness levels now display correctly - no more "Unknown" for valid schools

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Inconsistent Success Rate Calculations (July 19, 2025)
- **User Report**: "why the success rate showing different value?"
- **Bug Found**: Main card showing different success rate than P1 Analytics
  - **Main Card**: 100% (only calculated Phase 2C data)
  - **P1 Analytics**: 94% (calculated from all phases - correct)
- **Root Cause**: `getSuccessRate()` function in both SchoolResults.jsx and SchoolComparison.jsx only used Phase 2C data
- **Example (Queenstown Primary)**:
  - **Wrong Calculation**: Phase 2C only: 26 taken / 26 applied = 100%
  - **Correct Calculation**: All phases: 148 taken / 158 applied = 94%
- **Fix Applied**:
  - **SchoolResults.jsx**: Updated `getSuccessRate()` to calculate from all phases (1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2C Supp)
  - **SchoolComparison.jsx**: Updated `getSuccessRate()` to use same overall calculation
  - **Logic**: `totalTaken / totalApplied * 100` across all phases
- **Result**: Both main card and P1 Analytics now show consistent success rates

#### ‚úÖ Fixed Large Gap Between Sections (July 19, 2025)
- **User Issue**: Large, excessive gap between the hero section and search card 
- **Root Cause**: Excessive padding and margins stacking up:
  - Hero section: `py-16` (top/bottom padding) + `mb-20` (bottom margin)
  - Search section: `py-16` (top/bottom padding)
  - Total gap: 16 + 20 + 16 = 52 spacing units (too much!)
- **Solution**: Optimized spacing for better visual flow:
  - Hero section: `pt-16 pb-8` (reduced bottom padding from 16 to 8)
  - Removed `mb-20` bottom margin from hero content
  - Search section: `pt-8 pb-16` (reduced top padding from 16 to 8)  
  - New total gap: 8 + 8 = 16 spacing units (perfect!)
- **Result**: Clean, connected visual flow between hero and search card sections
- **Build**: Successful in 1.92s with no issues

- **Result**: Beautiful, modern search card that perfectly matches the user's design vision with improved user flow

#### ‚úÖ Streamlined Landing Page (July 19, 2025)
- **User Request**: Remove both the "Trusted by Parents Across Singapore" statistics section and "Why Parents Choose Our Platform" section from the bottom
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive cleanup including:
  - **Trust Indicators Section**: Removed "Trusted by Parents Across Singapore" with 180+ statistics grid

- **Result**: Much cleaner, more focused landing page without potentially misleading claims
- **Performance Impact**: 
  - CSS bundle: 46.43 kB ‚Üí 45.36 kB (-1.07 kB, -2.3% reduction)
  - JS bundle: 873.55 kB ‚Üí 868.04 kB (-5.51 kB, -0.6% reduction)
