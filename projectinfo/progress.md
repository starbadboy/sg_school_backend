# School Finder Project Progress

## Current Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED - OneMap Integration (Fixed)

### Recent Achievements

#### ‚úÖ OneMap Integration Fixed (July 19, 2025)
- **Issue**: Initial implementation used non-existent OneMap JavaScript API, causing "Map Unavailable" error
- **Root Cause**: OneMap doesn't provide a direct JavaScript SDK, only map tiles and REST APIs
- **Solution**: Switched to proper integration using Leaflet.js with OneMap tiles
- **New Implementation**:
  - **Leaflet.js Integration**: Uses official Leaflet.js library with OneMap tile service
  - **OneMap Tiles**: `https://www.onemap.gov.sg/maps/tiles/Default/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`
  - **Custom Markers**: HTML-based div icons with school numbering and competitiveness colors
  - **Interactive Popups**: Click markers for school details and selection
  - **Auto-fit Bounds**: Map automatically zooms to show all schools and user location
  - **Proper Attribution**: Includes required OneMap attribution

#### ‚úÖ Map Features (Working)
- üìç **School Markers**: Numbered markers colored by competitiveness (red=very competitive, green=less competitive)
- üè† **User Location**: Blue marker showing where the user is located
- üí¨ **Popups**: Click any marker to see school details, distance, balloting status, and selection buttons
- üîç **Smart Zoom**: Automatically fits all schools and user location in view
- üì± **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop with fullscreen option
