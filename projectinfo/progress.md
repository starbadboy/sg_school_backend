### âœ… **Railway Database Deployment Fix (December 19, 2024)**

**ðŸš¨ Problem**: SQLite database error on Railway deployment:
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file
```

**ðŸ”§ Root Cause**: 
- Hardcoded SQLite database path not compatible with Railway container filesystem
- Database directory wasn't being created properly
- No fallback for Railway's PostgreSQL service

**âœ… Solution Implemented:**

1. **Railway-Compatible Database Configuration**:
   - **PostgreSQL Support**: Automatically detects `DATABASE_URL` from Railway PostgreSQL service
   - **URL Format Fix**: Converts `postgres://` to `postgresql://` for SQLAlchemy compatibility
   - **Robust SQLite Fallback**: Creates database directory with proper error handling
   - **Multiple Fallback Paths**: Uses temp directory if primary path fails

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - **Graceful Degradation**: App continues running even if database setup has issues
   - **Clear Logging**: Shows which database type and path is being used
   - **Environment Detection**: Different behavior for local vs Railway deployment

3. **Production Dependencies**:
   - **Added psycopg2-binary**: PostgreSQL driver for Railway PostgreSQL support
   - **Updated Requirements**: `sg_school_backend/requirements.txt` includes PostgreSQL driver

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - **Railway Guide**: Enhanced `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` with PostgreSQL setup steps
   - **Database Troubleshooting**: Added specific fix for SQLite path errors
   - **Environment Variables**: Clear instructions for DATABASE_URL configuration

**âœ… Deployment Options Now Available:**
- **Option 1 (Recommended)**: Railway with PostgreSQL service - persistent, scalable database
- **Option 2 (Fallback)**: Railway with SQLite - uses robust path detection and temp fallback
- **Option 3 (Local)**: Local development with SQLite in project directory

**ðŸ”§ Technical Changes:**
- `sg_school_backend/src/main.py` - Enhanced database configuration function
- `sg_school_backend/requirements.txt` - Added PostgreSQL driver
- `RAILWAY-DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md` - Updated with PostgreSQL setup and troubleshooting

### âœ… **Complete Mobile Responsiveness Audit (December 19, 2024)**

**ðŸ“± COMPREHENSIVE MOBILE TESTING COMPLETED:**

1. **âœ… Landing Page**: Perfect mobile layout with responsive header, search interface, and feature sections
2. **âœ… School Directory**: Excellent search functionality with mobile-optimized result cards
3. **âœ… School Detail View**: Clean mobile layout with tabs and information cards
4. **âœ… School Rankings**: **MAJOR FIX** - Converted broken desktop table to beautiful mobile card layout
5. **âœ… Find Schools (Location Search)**: Perfect mobile interface with address input and radius selection
6. **âœ… P1 Registration Guide**: Excellent mobile layout with phase timeline and process steps

### ðŸ”§ **Critical Mobile Fix - School Rankings Table:**

**Problem**: Desktop table completely unreadable on mobile (overlapping columns, squished text)

**Solution**: Implemented responsive design pattern:
- **Desktop (md+)**: Original table layout with full columns
- **Mobile (<md)**: Beautiful card layout with:
  - Individual school cards with rank badges and award icons
  - 2x2 information grid with color-coded data boxes
  - Clean typography and proper spacing
  - All 50+ schools perfectly formatted and readable

### ðŸŽ¯ **Mobile Navigation Enhancement:**

**âœ… Mobile Header Fixed:**
- **Desktop**: Full navigation tabs visible
- **Mobile**: Hamburger menu with smooth dropdown
- **Features**: Menu auto-closes on navigation, active state highlighting, full-width overlay

### âœ… **Original Backend API Rollback Success (December 19, 2024)**

**Problem**: Changes during "feat: add comprehensive school ranking page" commit broke the main school search functionality
- `/api/schools/search-by-name` endpoint returning errors
- Frontend errors: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')"
- Rankings page showing JSON parsing errors

**Solution**: Clean rollback to original working version + selective restoration

**Actions Taken:**
1. **Complete Rollback**: Restored `sg_school_backend/src/routes/schools.py` to commit f5fcbc4 (last known working state)
2. **Selective Restoration**: Re-added only the `/rankings` endpoint with correct field names
3. **Fixed Field References**: `School.overall_competitiveness_score` and `school.name` (not `school_name`)
4. **Frontend Integration**: Updated frontend to work with original API format
5. **Original UI Restored**: Reverted to Phase 2C data display (vacancies, applicants, ratio) instead of abstract competitiveness scores

**Current Working Features:**
- âœ… **School Search**: Perfect `/api/schools/search-by-name` endpoint 
- âœ… **School Detail**: Complete `/api/schools/school-detail/<name>` endpoint
- âœ… **School Rankings**: Working `/api/schools/rankings` with original meaningful data
- âœ… **Filtering**: Top N limit, tier filter, balloted-only filter all working
- âœ… **Summary Statistics**: Total schools (180), balloted schools (107), average ratio (0.829)

**API Response Format (Restored Original):**
```json
{
  "query": "fa",
  "suggestions": [
    {"name": "Fairfield Methodist School (Primary)", "has_p1_data": true, ...}
  ],
  "total": 3
}
```

**Frontend Integration:**
- All React components use defensive programming to prevent crashes
- School Rankings component shows Phase 2C data (vacancies/applicants/ratio) 
- Proper error handling for undefined properties
- Mobile-responsive design throughout
