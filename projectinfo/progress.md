# School Finder Progress Log

## Latest Update: January 19, 2025

### ‚úÖ **FINE-TUNED FUZZY SEARCH - PERFECT GOVERNMENT API MATCHING**

**Problem Identified**: Government API school names didn't match database names
- **Government API**: `"FAIRFIELD METHODIST SCHOOL (PRIMARY)"`, `"NEW TOWN PRIMARY SCHOOL"`
- **Database Names**: `"Fairfield Methodist"`, `"New Town"`
- **Result**: Frontend showed zeros instead of real P1 data

**Enhanced Fuzzy Search Algorithm - 6 Layers**:

1. **Direct Exact Match**: Standard case-insensitive lookup
2. **Aggressive Suffix Removal**: Removes ` school (primary)`, ` primary school`, ` school`, ` primary`, ` (primary)`, ` (pri)`, ` pri`
3. **Enhanced Word Matching**: 
   - ALL significant words must match (3+ characters)
   - 80%+ word match fallback for partial matches
4. **Key-Based Matching**: Normalized key lookup with cleaned names
5. **Pattern-Specific Matching**: Special handling for common school types
6. **Multi-Variant Search**: Multiple search patterns per school type

**Perfect Test Results**:
```
‚úÖ "NEW TOWN PRIMARY SCHOOL" ‚Üí New Town (180 vacancy, 65 applied)
‚úÖ "FAIRFIELD METHODIST SCHOOL (PRIMARY)" ‚Üí Fairfield Methodist (270 vacancy, 271 applied) 
‚úÖ "QUEENSTOWN PRIMARY SCHOOL" ‚Üí Queenstown (210 vacancy, 188 applied)
‚úÖ "ANDERSON PRIMARY SCHOOL" ‚Üí Anderson (210 vacancy, 214 applied)
‚úÖ "ANG MO KIO PRIMARY SCHOOL" ‚Üí Ang Mo Kio (150 vacancy, 107 applied)
```

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Enhanced `extract_p1_data_for_school()`**: Comprehensive government API name handling
- **Enhanced `enrich_school_with_p1_data()`**: Same logic for school search results
- **Backward Compatibility**: Original names still work perfectly
- **Performance**: Efficient multi-layer matching with early returns

**User Impact**:
- ‚úÖ **Real Data Display**: Frontend now shows correct P1 data (270 vacancy vs previous 0)
- ‚úÖ **Government API Compatible**: All official school names match perfectly
- ‚úÖ **No More Zeros**: Phase 2C Applied shows real numbers (271 vs previous 0)
- ‚úÖ **Correct Balloting Status**: Shows actual balloted status (Yes vs previous No)
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Competitiveness**: Real tiers (Highly Competitive vs previous Unknown)

### ‚úÖ **ELIMINATED MOCK DATA - HONEST DATA POLICY IMPLEMENTED**

**Change**: Replaced all mock/simulated P1 data with "No Data Available" responses
- **Before**: System generated fake realistic P1 data for schools not in database
- **After**: System honestly reports when data is unavailable

**Technical Changes**:
- Removed `generate_default_p1_data()` function (83 lines of mock data generation code)
- Updated `extract_p1_data_for_school()` to return structured "no data" response
- Updated `enrich_school_with_p1_data()` to handle missing data gracefully
- Updated strategy generation to accommodate schools without data
- Updated competitiveness analysis to handle "no data" schools

**New Response Format for Missing Data**:
```json
{
  "year": 2024,
  "school_name": "Example School",
  "data_available": false,
  "message": "No P1 data available for this school in our database",
  "total_schools_in_database": 180,
  "suggestion": "Please check the school name or try searching for similar schools"
}
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ **Honest user experience** - no misleading fake data
- ‚úÖ **Clear data availability** - users know what's real vs unavailable
- ‚úÖ **Reduced confusion** - eliminates false expectations from simulated data
- ‚úÖ **Cleaner codebase** - removed 80+ lines of mock data generation logic
- ‚úÖ **Strategy accuracy** - AI strategies based on real data only

### ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE DATABASE MIGRATION COMPLETED**

**Achievement**: Successfully migrated all 180 Singapore primary schools with complete 2024 P1 data
- **Data Source**: Real data from sgschooling.com comprehensive table
- **Coverage**: 100% of provided schools (180 schools)
- **Verification**: Confirmed with Fairfield Methodist test case (271 applied, 44 accepted, balloted, highly competitive)

**Migration Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Complete P1 Phase Data**: All 6 phases (1, 2A, 2B, 2C, 2C-Supp, 3) with applied/accepted/balloted status
- ‚úÖ **Competitiveness Metrics**: Automated tier classification and scoring
- ‚úÖ **JSON Storage**: Efficient phase data storage using SQLAlchemy JSON fields
- ‚úÖ **Data Integrity**: All schools verified with correct totals and phase breakdowns
- ‚úÖ **School Key Normalization**: Consistent lookup keys for reliable matching

**Database Schema**:
- **School Model**: 180 records with complete P1 data
- **JSON Fields**: `phase_1_data`, `phase_2a_data`, `phase_2b_data`, `phase_2c_data`, `phase_2c_supp_data`, `competitiveness_metrics`
- **Metadata**: `total_vacancy`, `balloted`, `year`, `competitiveness_tier`, `overall_competitiveness_score`

### ‚úÖ **ADVANCED FUZZY SEARCH IMPLEMENTED**

**Problem Solved**: School name variations causing data mismatches
- **Example**: "Fairfield Methodist School (Primary)" now finds "Fairfield Methodist" in database

**6-Layer Matching Algorithm**:
1. **Exact Key Match**: Direct database key lookup
2. **Name Fuzzy Match**: Case-insensitive partial name matching  
3. **Cleaned Name Match**: Removes suffixes like "School", "(Primary)", "Primary School"
4. **Word-by-Word Match**: Matches significant words (4+ characters)
5. **Advanced Word Match**: Cross-references all words against school names
6. **Pattern-Specific Match**: Special handling for common school types (Methodist, CHIJ, Catholic, etc.)

**Test Results - All Variations Work**:
- ‚úÖ "Fairfield Methodist School (Primary)" ‚Üí Real data (270 vacancy, 271 applied)
- ‚úÖ "FAIRFIELD METHODIST SCHOOL (PRIMARY)" ‚Üí Real data
