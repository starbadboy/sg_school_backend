### UI Data Display Fix
**Date**: Current Session  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

**What was fixed:**
- 🚫 **Hide Zero Success Rates**: When P1 data is all zeros (no vacancies, applicants, or places filled), success rate badges are no longer displayed

- ✅ **Overall Success Rate Logic**: Uses `> 0` condition instead of truthiness check for overall rates
- ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles edge cases where all phase data is zero

**User Experience Improvement:**
- 🎨 **Cleaner Interface**: No more misleading "0% Success Rate" when there's simply no data
- 📈 **Meaningful Metrics**: Success rates only appear when they provide actual insight
- 🧹 **Reduced Clutter**: Phases with no activity show clean, uncluttered data presentation
