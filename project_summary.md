## Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ Successfully Completed
- Backend API fully functional and tested
- All endpoints responding correctly
- Data integration working properly
- Public access available via: `https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Frontend Rendering Issue
- React application built successfully
- Static files served correctly by Flask
- Frontend not rendering in browser (white screen)

### üîß Workaround Solutions
1. **API Testing**: All backend functionality can be tested directly via API calls
2. **Separate Deployment**: Frontend and backend can be deployed independently
3. **Build Configuration**: Issue likely related to Vite/Flask integration

## Sample API Usage

### School Search
```bash
curl -X POST https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer/api/schools/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6", "radius": 2}'
```

### Strategy Generation
```bash
curl -X POST https://5000-i057r40f8nh1tyoau3dq6-f2376479.manusvm.computer/api/strategy/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "address": "Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6",
    "target_schools": ["Anderson Primary School", "Ang Mo Kio Primary School"],
    "has_siblings": false,
    "willing_to_volunteer": true,
    "can_relocate": false
  }'
```
